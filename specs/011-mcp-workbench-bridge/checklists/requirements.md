# Specification Quality Checklist: Dual-Chat Work Tracking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation was rerun after the user fixed the Phase 1 host scope, completion/publication split,
  current-session AI responsibility, scoped lexical/semantic retrieval, one application/persistence
  boundary, durable event-log plus background projection, late-event watermark behavior, and
  refresh-before-safe-retry semantics. The specification has no unresolved clarification and all
  sixteen checklist items pass.
